Quick Start
===========

To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you have Node.js â‰¥ 14 installed (https://nodejs.org), then use it to install [yarn]: `npm install --global yarn` (or just `npm i -g yarn`)
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install` (or just `yarn`)

Setup
======
```
git clone https://github.com/Bild96/DataBazaar.git
cd  DataBazaar
yarn install
yarn test
```

Deploy Smart Contract
=====================

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts]. 
When you run `yarn dev`, your smart contracts get deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a throwaway account. When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how.


Step 0: Install near-cli
--------------------------

You need near-cli installed globally. Here's how:

    npm install --global near-cli

This will give you the `near` [CLI] tool. Ensure that it's installed with:

    near --version


Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Visit [NEAR Wallet] and make a new account. You'll be deploying these smart contracts to this new account.

Now authorize NEAR CLI for this new account, and follow the instructions it gives you:

    near login

Step 2: deploy!
---------------

One command:

    yarn deploy

As you can see in `package.json`, this builds & deploys smart contracts to NEAR TestNet.

Note down the smart contract account id from the console and update it in src/config.js:1


Run the Frontend
================

Run the following commands from the near-registry folder

```
cd src
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then visit http://localhost:1234 from your browser to test the Near Registry

Deploy the Frontend using netlify
=================================

Run the following commands from the near-registry folder

```
cd src
yarn build
yarn global add netlify-cli
netlify login
netlify deploy --prod
```

Then follow the instructions given by the netlify cli and specify `./dist` as the publish directory
